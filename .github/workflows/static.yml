Enable "Enforce HTTPS"2. In GitHub repo settings → Pages, add your custom domain1. Update the `CNAME` file with your domain nameIf you have a custom domain:### Step 2: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)4. The workflow will automatically deploy on push to `main`3. Under "Build and deployment", select **GitHub Actions** as the source2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Pages**1. Go to your repository on GitHub### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages## Deployment to GitHub PagesThis creates a `dist/` folder with all production-ready files.```npm run build```bash### Production Build   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`4. **Open in browser**   ```   npm run dev   ```bash3. **Start development server**   ```   npm install   ```bash2. **Install dependencies**   ```   cd YOUR_REPO   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git   ```bash1. **Clone the repository**### Local Development- A GitHub account (for deployment)- Git- npm (comes with Node.js)- Node.js 18 or higher### Prerequisites## Quick Start- **Admin Panel**: Manage all content with a password-protected admin interface- **Member Rankings**: Leaderboard showing top contributors- **Awards System**: 8 achievement badges for community contributions- **Discussion Board**: Community discussions with categories and search- **Events System**: Track community, business, historical, and outdoor events- **Business Directory**: Add and manage local businesses with geocoding- **County & City Pages**: Detailed information about Montana's counties and cities- **Interactive Map**: Leaflet-powered map with county boundaries and custom layers## FeaturesMontana County Explorer is an interactive educational map application for exploring Montana's 56 counties, cities, businesses, and events.
