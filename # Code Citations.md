# YAML Parsing Error Explanation

The error you're seeing is a **YAML syntax error** caused by placing Markdown content directly in a YAML file without proper formatting.

## The Problem

In your `static.yml` file (lines 228-261), you have Markdown documentation content (README-style text) mixed into what should be a GitHub Actions workflow file. YAML has strict syntax rules, and characters like `:`, `` ` ``, `#`, and `-` have special meanings.

The specific error points to this problematic pattern:

```
`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`1…
```

YAML interprets:
- The backticks (`` ` ``) as invalid characters
- The colons (`:`) as key-value separators
- The result is a parsing failure

## The Solution

Your `static.yml` should **only contain valid GitHub Actions workflow YAML**, not documentation. Here's what a correct workflow file looks like:

```yaml
# filepath: c:\Users\jonro\OneDrive\Documents\mtdashboard\competent-lamarr\.github\workflows\static.yml
# Simple workflow for deploying static content to GitHub Pages
name: Deploy static content to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents:
```

# YAML Parsing Error Explanation

The error you're seeing is a **YAML syntax error** caused by placing Markdown content directly in a YAML file without proper formatting.

## The Problem

In your `static.yml` file (lines 228-261), you have Markdown documentation content (README-style text) mixed into what should be a GitHub Actions workflow file. YAML has strict syntax rules, and characters like `:`, `` ` ``, `#`, and `-` have special meanings.

The specific error points to this problematic pattern:

```
`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`1…
```

YAML interprets:
- The backticks (`` ` ``) as invalid characters
- The colons (`:`) as key-value separators
- The result is a parsing failure

## The Solution

Your `static.yml` should **only contain valid GitHub Actions workflow YAML**, not documentation. Here's what a correct workflow file looks like:

```yaml
# filepath: c:\Users\jonro\OneDrive\Documents\mtdashboard\competent-lamarr\.github\workflows\static.yml

  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages

# YAML Parsing Error Explanation

The error you're seeing is a **YAML syntax error** caused by placing Markdown content directly in a YAML file without proper formatting.

## The Problem

In your `static.yml` file (lines 228-261), you have Markdown documentation content (README-style text) mixed into what should be a GitHub Actions workflow file. YAML has strict syntax rules, and characters like `:`, `` ` ``, `#`, and `-` have special meanings.

The specific error points to this problematic pattern:

```
`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`1…
```

YAML interprets:
- The backticks (`` ` ``) as invalid characters
- The colons (`:`) as key-value separators
- The result is a parsing failure

## The Solution

Your `static.yml` should **only contain valid GitHub Actions workflow YAML**, not documentation. Here's what a correct workflow file looks like:

```yaml
# filepath: c:\Users\jonro\OneDrive\Documents\mtdashboard\competent-lamarr\.github\workflows\static.yml
# Simple workflow for deploying static content to GitHub Pages
name: Deploy static content to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-
```
